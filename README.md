## Parsing World's Skylines with Shape Constrained MRFs

Created by Subhransu Maji, Rashmi Tonge and C.V. Jawahar

### Introduction

Shape constrained MRFs are desined to exploit the tiered structure and the rectangular shapes of the builings in typical skyline images to enable faster and more accurate labelling. We are also releasing a skyline-12 dataset consisting of 120 high resolution images with each building individually labelled split into training, validation and test set for evaluation purposes.
